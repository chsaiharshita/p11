Globally, research & development activities and innovations are increasingly becoming multidisciplinary and collaborative, and require substantial communication/computational power. For India to emerge as a significant R&D hub, it has to become a part of this wave of collaboration and co-creation. The idea of setting up of a National Knowledge Network was deliberated at the office of Principal Scientific Advisor to the Government of India and the National Knowledge Commission engagements were held with key stakeholders including experts, potential users, telecom service providers and educational and research institutions. These discussions have yielded a consensus on the optimal approach to be adopted for setting up such a network, to provide a unified high speed network backbone for all the sectors."

For example, in a city with Dual PoPs, the interconnection between the NKN PoPs and the end users will be as shown in the figure. In such scenarios, institutes that can demonstrate the need for extremely high availability can be provided with the last mile from different NLDs to the two different NKN PoPs. Institutes in such cities with 1 Gbps bandwidth would be connecting using Optical Fiber Cable (OFC) with in-built protection by the NLD, and the remote end will be terminated on both the NKN PoPs; one of the NKN PoPs will act as the Primary or active link; in case of primary link failure, the secondary NKN PoP would become active.

More recently, data on HIV-1 protease substrate complexes have been collected, and the refined map shows clear density for the ligand molecules in the active site.
