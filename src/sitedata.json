Why does their heart get full of hatred and dislike for one another? Are you also facing such a situation in your relationship right now? Well if you are then we can help you out in understanding and solving this problem. Remember one thing and that is never run away from your problems. Deal with it and try to fix things. Don't give up and don't think it's the end. A beautiful relationship, a loving partner and a trusted husband is all a woman can dream of so don't just give in to the problems and end everything and then repent all your life. Try to save your marriage and relationship."

It is quite natural for one member of the relationship to experience disappointment, fear, and worry if the other member is dominant, likes to rule and doesn't give a damn about your feelings and thoughts.

The impulse to run away is paramount, but the reality is you can not run away from yourself. It is essential that you know what your part is in the relationship that makes it not work for you. When each member of the couple can face their inner feelings and behaviour patterns and learns to take responsibility for their actions and behaviour without blaming one another, the couple has the opportunity for the marriage or relationship to be repaired and saved."

Though we might think that our partner deserved it but what we are doing is instead of trying to solve the problem we are simply deteriorating it.

Do things that make you feel good both physically and mentally. Making behaviour and character changes requires a great deal of energy; therefore, what you need is support from within and that will happen only if you are relaxed and calm.
